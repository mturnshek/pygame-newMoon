# pygame_newMoon
Arcade pygame

After cloning, create a new virutal environment and install the requirements with
  
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  
Then, run the game with

  $ python project.py

The game can be played with a Keyboard or an Xbox Controller.

If you're using a keyboard, the controls are:

Left -> a
Right -> d
Down (Fastfall) -> s
Jump -> Spacebar
Shoot -> M
Dash -> N
Pause -> P
Restart Game -> R

If you're using an XBox controller, the controls are displayed in-game.

The game runs kind of slow unless you have a good CPU, unfortunately.
