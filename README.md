# pygame_newMoon
Arcade pygame

## Installation

After cloning, create a new virutal environment and install the requirements with
```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
Then, run the game with
```
  $ python project.py
```
## Usage

If you're using a keyboard, the controls are:

Left -> a

Right -> d

Down (Fastfall) -> s

Jump -> Spacebar

Shoot -> M

Dash -> N

Pause -> P

Restart Game -> R

If you're using an XBox controller, the controls are displayed in-game.

Unfortunately, the game is a little slow unless you have a good CPU.
